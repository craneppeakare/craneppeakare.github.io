      <description>Finally my long awaited review of the book &amp;ldquo;Ultralearning&amp;rdquo; by Scott H. Young. I have been putting this off for far too long. This will not be a summary of the book as I have already done so in another post which you can find here. As someone who loves constantly learning new hobbies I thought this book would be right up my alley for leveling up my abilities.&#xA;The book opens itself well by defining the demographic who would benefit the most from this book.</description>

      <description>The Rubik&amp;rsquo;s Cube, invented in 1974 by Ern≈ë Rubik, is a icon of pop culture appearing in major shows such as The Big Bang Theory, The Simpsons, various Spiderman movies, and even in Rick and Morty. Although pop culture loves to portray the puzzle as if only geniuses can solve the cube, in reality anyone can learn to solve one is as little as 5 minutes. And if you invest a little bit more time you can gain the skills to solve it in under 60 seconds and impress all your friends.</description>

      <title>[Summary] Ultralearning by Scott H. Young</title>
      <link>https://craneppeakare.github.io/books/ultralearningsummary/</link>

      <description>This is a no-bullshit summary of the book &amp;ldquo;Ultralearning&amp;rdquo; by Scott H. Young. Before getting to the 9 principles of what makes an effective Ultralearner, Schott H. Young prefaces by explaining the manic-level obbession that many ultralearners exhibit to their chosen skill. They obsess over every tiny efficiency and detail, and while this degree of obsession may be difficult to achieve for a skill meant just as a simple hobby or to promote skills beneficial to your work force, learning their principles can help you become a more effective learning for anything you may wish to pursue in your life.</description>

      <title>Creating an Infinite Scroller Minesweeper App</title>

      <description>Right away I knew it would be a great concept however, I was by no means a game dev. Sure, I&amp;rsquo;ve dabbled here in there making basic platformers and getting used to the basic functions of a game through engines like Godot and Pygame. I sure as hell didn&amp;rsquo;t know anything about mobile game dev. So how did I do it?&#xA;It all started when I had the idea to combine the typical infinite scroller style mobile games with an age old classic, Minesweeper, which to my knowledge hadn&amp;rsquo;t been done yet before.</description>

      <description>So me and my close friends love playing Discord&amp;rsquo;s in-client game Letter League, which is based off of the popular word game Scrabble. We&amp;rsquo;d play for hours at a time and one of our friends in particular, we will call him &amp;ldquo;Nigel&amp;rdquo;, tends to consistently win somewhat often. And I&amp;rsquo;m an ultra competitive person so I built a trainer program to help me find 7 letter words, known as &amp;ldquo;bingos&amp;rdquo; in scabble, and go on the training arc of my life and beat him to the ground.</description>

      <description>Right away I knew it would be a great concept however, I was by no means a game dev. Sure, I&amp;rsquo;ve dabbled here in there making basic platformers and getting used to the basic functions of a game through engines like Godot and Pygame. I sure as hell didn&amp;rsquo;t know anything about mobile game dev. So how did I do it?&#xA;It all started when I had the idea to combine the typical infinite scroller style mobile games with an age old classic, Minesweeper, which to my knowledge hadn&amp;rsquo;t been done yet before.</description>

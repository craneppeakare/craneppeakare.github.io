      <description>Right away I knew it would be a great concept however, I was by no means a game dev. Sure, I&amp;rsquo;ve dabbled here in there making basic platformers and getting used to the basic functions of a game through engines like Godot and Pygame. I sure as hell didn&amp;rsquo;t know anything about mobile game dev. So how did I do it?
It all started when I had the idea to combine the typical infinite scroller style mobile games with an age old classic, Minesweeper, which to my knowledge hadn&amp;rsquo;t been done yet before.</description>

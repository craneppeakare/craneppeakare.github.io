<p>Right away I knew it would be a great concept however, I was by no means a game dev. Sure, I&rsquo;ve dabbled here in there making basic platformers and getting used to the basic functions of a game through engines like <a href="https://godotengine.org">Godot</a> and <a href="https://www.pygame.org">Pygame</a>. I sure as hell didn&rsquo;t know anything about <em>mobile</em> game dev. So how did I do it?</p>
<p>It all started when I had the idea to combine the typical infinite scroller style mobile games with an age old classic, Minesweeper, which to my knowledge hadn&rsquo;t been done yet before. Now, I am by no means a game dev but this was a game I was determined to create.</p>
<h2 id="the-plan">The plan</h2>
<p>I first new the most basic requirements. First, it had to have all the normal logic in a standard Minesweeper game. And secondly, it would be programmatically split in to what I call &ldquo;chunks&rdquo;. Each chunk would be it&rsquo;s own board and keep track of how many mines where in there. And once all mines in a chunk were flagged it would clear and scroll upwards. As we scrolled up the chunks would then raise in difficulty up to a maximum. Of course, this was easier said than done as I was met with a number of different issues during development. But before that, we needed to decide on one thing.</p>
<h2 id="the-framework">The framework</h2>
<p>What game framework do we use? Initially I tried to use Godot because it was already familiar to me since my last game dev project used Godot. But it soon became obvious that I was having trouble picking up gd script and the heavily Object-oriented structure of nodes was making it difficult to programmatically generate new chunks. So I continued to look around. That&rsquo;s when I found <a href="https://phaser.io/phaser3">Phaser 3</a>. It looked simple enough at first glance and I managed to spin up a prototype of a clickable tile relatively quickly considering it was the first exposure to it. So I decided this would be the chosen framework.</p>
<h2 id="developing-the-game">Developing the game</h2>
<p>First of all, there needed to be cross-chunk communication. Where mines in one chunk needed to be able to tell the mines around it in a different chunk that a mine was adjacent to it. This wasn&rsquo;t too big of an issue as the solution I went for basically consisted of making a doubley-linked list so each chunk can point to the pevious and next chunk in line and moving the <code>getNeighboringCells()</code> function to the list-level.</p>
<p>Another issue I ran into was when to check if a chunk was complete. And on completeion, if we needed to scroll the chunks down. Since two chunks are fully visible, the user can complete the top one first and we would not want to scroll the incomplete chunk underneath off yet. Currently everytime the user clicks and after we run the game logic for digging up tiles we run a check to see if any chunks are complete. Any complete chunks are highlighted in cyan and automatically flagged and locked to prevent the user from blowing themselves up.</p>
<p>All of the assets are drawn by me (Except for the running cat)! And I think I did a pretty good job especially with the flags and the shovel icon. I tried to design the UI and overlay loosely based on the original microsoft Minesweeper game as seen below. The buttons I also designed to programmatically create the same type of bevels as seen in the original game. While the checkerboard green and brown layers are modeled after <a href="https://www.google.com/fbx?fbx=minesweeper">Google&rsquo;s Minesweeper</a> which I found to be very pleasant to look at. The font being used is called <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Silkscreen">Silkscreen</a> from google fonts designed by Jason Kottke which I find fit the aesthetic of the game well.</p>

<h2 id="lessons-i-learned-this-project">Lessons I learned this project</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Start using <a href="https://trello.com">Trello</a> from the beginning.</strong></p>
<p>At a certain point mid-project I was discovering bug after bug and often times I would lose track of the upcoming features I wanted to implement. Employing an organizing tool such as Tello helped time-management by providing an easy way to keep track of known bugs and features to implement while storing their respective time estimates. This made it easy to plan which cards to focus on for the day and track my progress. This also enabled the invaluable ability to categorize cards into <code>BUG</code>, <code>REQUIRED</code>, or <code>NICE TO HAVE</code> features which made prioritization simple.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Documentation goes a long way</strong></p>
<p>There was a point where I decided to add javadocs to every function I made because it made it so much easier to read and figure out what was going on. The documentation for Phaser 3 however, left a lot to be desired. Often times parameter definitions weren&rsquo;t very helpful and I had to jump through many different pages to figure out how to create something. One particular instance was when dealing with audio there was a <code>setVolume()</code> function that took in a number. The documentation however did not specify the format of the number so I innocently passed the number <code>20</code> into it hoping that it meant 20% volume but in reality, <code>number</code> meant anything from 0 to 1, where 1 was maximum volume. This ended up blasting the sound 20 times louder than the original straight into my ear canals leading to a less than ideal recovery process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Double or even triple the time estimate for everything.</strong></p>
<p>I feel like we all re-leaarn this lesson from every project undertaking. We&rsquo;ve all been here, we estimate a task will take a few hours to compelte and it ends up taking several days worth of effort. And this is no exception. I initially thought it would take one week to complete a working prototype of the game. Jokes on me it took me almost 3 weeks to reach that state because I hadn&rsquo;t accounted for learning a new framework, testing and debugging, asset design, and task organization. It then took another several weeks of polish to ultimately get the game to it&rsquo;s current state as well. So it goes without saying, be extremely generous with your time estimates!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mobile deployment is hell</strong></p>
<p>It boggles my mind how it&rsquo;s still so difficult to port apps to the mobile for both apple and android. Why must I be forced to download a different OS or IDE just to port to a mobile app? Maybe one day I will figure this out but for now it seems much more pain than it&rsquo;s worth.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This was overall a fun project. Although I don&rsquo;t see myself often ever dabbling with game dev it is a refreshing treat from time to time. It&rsquo;s taught me some valuable lessons and it can easily be hosted on a static website that can be opened on mobile. I primarily enjoyed the process of creating a plan then executing it to the best of my ability. But I do recommend creating some sort of game as a beginner project as resources are plentiful and it&rsquo;s an extremely easy showcase.</p>

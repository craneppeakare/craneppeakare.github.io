      <description>This is a no-bullshit summary of the book &amp;ldquo;Ultralearning&amp;rdquo; by Scott H. Young. Before getting to the 9 principles of what makes an effective Ultralearner, Schott H. Young prefaces by explaining the manic-level obbession that many ultralearners exhibit to their chosen skill. They obsess over every tiny efficiency and detail, and while this degree of obsession may be difficult to achieve for a skill meant just as a simple hobby or to promote skills beneficial to your work force, learning their principles can help you become a more effective learning for anything you may wish to pursue in your life.</description>
